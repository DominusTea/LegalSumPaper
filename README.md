## Introduction  
This repository holds the code used for the purposes of under review publication on Automated Summarization of Legal Judgements (el: *ŒëœÖœÑœåŒºŒ±œÑŒ∑ Œ†ŒµœÅŒØŒªŒ∑œàŒ∑ ŒîŒπŒ∫Œ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ ŒëœÄŒøœÜŒ¨œÉŒµœâŒΩ*).  
## Summarization
### Extractive Methods  
We experiment with various unsupervised models that are used in the literature. Each model can be found in the [models](models/) folder. We mainly utilized open-source ```python``` code & repositories, while making the appropriate changes to extend/correct the algorithms and to support the greek language.  
Currently we have implemented the following algorithms:  
- [LexRank](models/graph_based/LexRank) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2128)): by adapting [crabcamp's implementention](https://github.com/crabcamp/lexrank).  
- [Biased LexRank](models/graph_basd/LexRank)([paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306457308000666))
- Random Sentece: a random sentence extraction baseline

To summarize a dataset of legal judgements make sure the file used as input is either:  
- a directory with 2 folders; one named ```caselaw``` containing the full text of the judgement, and one named ```summary``` containg the summaries. Every file must by named using the template ```{index}.[json|csv]``` such that caselaws and summaries that share the shame index belong to the same judgement.  
- a ```.csv``` file containing all the data.  

In both cases, the columns containing the judgement's full-text and the summary must be named ```text``` and ```summary``` respectively.  
üíª Finally, to use the summarization script run the following:  
```
python3 summarize.py [-h] [-m [{lexrank,random_sentence, biased_lexrank}]] [-o [OUTPUT]] [--output_filetype {json,txt}] [-l LIMIT] file
```  
> üìö To get more information about summarize.py arguments run ```python3 summarize.py --help```  
### Abstractive Method
We utilize the Encoder-Decoder approach of [Liu and Lapata, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08345), where both Encoder and Decoder are initialized with the [Greek BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12014) weights.  
To train/evaluate the model run: 
```
bertLegalSum.py [-h] [--model_save_path MODEL_SAVE_PATH] [--model_load_path MODEL_LOAD_PATH] [--eval_output_file_path EVAL_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH]  [--reorder] [--remove_info] [--put_categs_at_start] file_path {train,eval,both}
```
> üìö To get more information about bert_legal_sum.py arguments run ```python3 bertLegalSum.py --help```   


## Evaluation  
We evaluate our models using the ROUGE automated metrics used in the automated summarization literature.  
- [ROUGE](evaluators/ROUGE) ([paper](https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/)): by adapting [Diego999's ROUGE script](https://github.com/Diego999/py-rouge) which reimplements the original ROUGE script (written in Pearl) in python. We make several extensions, including the ability to stem greek words and disable the deletion of greek characters.  

Before running the evaluation script, make sure the summaries (both reference and generated) lie in seperate folders and that each summary is named using the template ```{index}.[.json|csv]``` such tat the reference summaries and generated summaries that share the shame index summarize the same judgement. Also make sure, each summary file must have the summary under a column named ```summary```. In case both generated summary and reference summary lie in same folders, then the --summaries_together flag can be used.

üìè To use the evaluation script run the following:
```
python3 evaluate.py  [-h] [-o [OUTPUT]] [-m [METRIC]] [-l LIMIT] [--quiet QUIET] reference_sum generated_sum
```
> üìö To get more information about evaluate.py arguments run ```python3 evaluate.py --help```   

## Data crawling  
> üìö For more information on the data crawling, read the documentation in the [dataset folder](https://github.com/DominusTea/LegalSumPaper/tree/main/dataset).

## Data Analysis  
Data analysis (token-level statistics & [Grusky's et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11283) Coverage and Density) can be obtained by the [analysis.py file](https://github.com/DominusTea/LegalSumPaper/blobl/main/dataset/analysis.py) in the [dataset folder] the [dataset folder](https://github.com/DominusTea/LegalSumPaper/tree/main/dataset).
